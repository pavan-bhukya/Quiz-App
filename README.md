# Online Quiz App in Django

This is an online quiz organizing website project, developed using Python's web framework Django.<br>
For front-end designing we have used Twitter's front-end library Bootstrap4.

### Current Features

**Site access features:**


* Every quiz can be accessed only if the user is logged in.
* In the signing-up process the user is required to give the following information
	1. Full Name
	2. Email-id (unique for every user)
	3. Mobile Number (unique for every user)
	4. Roll No.
	5. Password
* For login the user will be required to enter *Email-id* and *Password* only

**Features of each quiz:**

* The logged in user either can create his own quiz or take an existing quiz.
* For creating the quiz, the user will be required to enter the *Title* of the quiz and questions and their corresponding options.
* Or the user can take the existing quiz.
* There will be timer of each quiz and the user is required to finish the quiz in time.
* When the timer stops, the corresponding record (i.e. number of correct answers) will be saved automatically.


**Dashboard features:**

* There are two type of dashboard
	1. Dashboard of corresponding user
	2. Global dashboard (i.e. Leaderboard)
* In the *Dashboard of corresponding user* the user can see his attempted quiz statistics <br>(i.e. *No. of Correct answers*, *Marks obtained* )
* In the *Global dashboard* there will be overall ranking of users who have attended the corresponding quiz.
